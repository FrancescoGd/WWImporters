# BIG FAT NOTE\! :bomb:

**This project is far from being even remotely production ready!**

I developed it while studying _Angular_ and it was the first almost-complete-app i wrote with it. It's full of incoherences (sometimes purposedly because I wanted to test different techniques to do the same thing - f.ex. sometimes I ```map+filter``` other times I loop with ```for```, sometimes I used both and so on). Additionally it's not \*-tested, has some unfinished or empty/mocked functions and has some bugs.

So, to summarize: have a look at it if you feel like but **absolutely don't use it in a real-world scenario**. If you do it, it's **at your own risk**.
